Android Contextual Action Bar (CAB) Demo - Highlighting list items on press
==========================

CAB-HighlightListItemOnPressDemo is a demo project that shows how to:

* Use a Contextual Action Bar (CAB)
* Launch CAB on list item long click
* Multiple selection of list items while on CAB
* Select item both on click and on long click
* Items highlighting on press, not on click (like done, for example, in the [Tasks][1] app)
* Correct handling of different selector states

CAB-HighlightListItemOnPressDemo should work in every version of Android from 2.x and up.

Usage
=====

In order to test the CAB, perform a long click over any of the items.
You can select/unselect items both using touches or the D-pad/trackpad.
